# 2024
No one at the North Pole has seen the Chief Historian (CH) for a while, but he has always been present for the sleigh launch event. Better go look for him, we need to find him before Christmas!

---
## Day 1
### *Better make a list and check it twice*
[code &#8614;](https://github.com/VereLanz/my-advent-2024/blob/main/my_advent/day1.py)
### Part One &#11088;
We need a list of location at which to look for the CH. In his office, two groups make two different lists. How different exactly are they, by list distance?

### Part Two &#11088;
Maybe not all of these numbers listed are correct numbers. Let's look at how similar the list entries actually are.

## Day 2
### *Red-Nosed Reactor Safety*
[code &#8614;](https://github.com/VereLanz/my-advent-2024/blob/main/my_advent/day2.py)
### Part One &#11088;
A list of reports needs to be checked for safe and unsafe ones. Only gradually in- or decreasing lines of numbers are good. 
How many are there?

### Part Two &#11088;
There is the option of adding a Problem Dampener, which allows us to remove 1 entry from each report to make it safe. 
How many safe reports are there now?

## Day 3
### *Corrupted Computers*
[code &#8614;](https://github.com/VereLanz/my-advent-2024/blob/main/my_advent/day3.py)
### Part One &#11088;
The warehouse computer is trying to send commands, but it comes out corrupted. 
Figure out which (`mul`) commands it was trying to send!

### Part Two &#11088;
Additionally, there are `do()` and `don't()` statements included, which affect the commands coming afterwards.
With this in mind, which `mul` commands are to be evaluated?

## Day 4
### *Word Search*
[code &#8614;](https://github.com/VereLanz/my-advent-2024/blob/main/my_advent/day4.py)
### Part One
An XMAS word search! Look for all the occureneces of XMAS in the word search. They can appear in all kind of directions!

### Part Two

## Day 6
### *Guards in 1518*
[code &#8614;](https://github.com/VereLanz/my-advent-2024/blob/main/my_advent/day6.py)
### Part One &#11088;
We have timetravelled to 1518, and are looking for the CH there. We must not meet people from that time,
so we have to avoid this guard here. How many spaces do they visit with their strict guarding pattern?

### Part Two
With one little extra obstruction, the guard could be set to walk in a loop. Find all the spots that could
work for this, how many are there?
